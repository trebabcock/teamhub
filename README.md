# Teamhub

Teamhub is (or will be) a place for teams to collaborate and share ideas.

# Features

### In Progress

- Feed
  - This is basically a small social network for the team. You can make posts with images, text, or links. You can comment on posts, and sticky posts.
- Chat
  - Multiple channels, with the ability to create new ones. Supports or will support images, embeds, file uploads, etc.

### Planned

- Spaces
  - This is where users can crate a "Space" to add files, text, code, artwork, etc. You'll be able to choose contributors and set the visibility to public or private.
- Git Integration
  - This will be for showing the activity of a GitHub organization, such as commits, PRs, issues, etc.
- Private Chat
  - Self-explanatory. This will be easy to implement after I get accounts working the way I want.
- Voice/Video Chat
  - This one is pretty far off right now. I'm not going to even start on it until all the other features are working properly.
